# Tuition DApp

Live on [tuition.0xmacro.com](https://tuition.0xmacro.com)!

## Functionality

This dapp connects to the deployed tuition smart contract, allowing Macro's students to deposit their 1 ETH payment, and according to the outcomes, getting refunded or moving to the DAO's treasury.

## Pricing display

Pricing required some thought since a dapp has to deal with the inherently unstable ETH prices. 

Ended up sticking to a 1 ETH payment so students will always see the same price on the landing page, rather than it constantly changing and making students feel like they're paying more/less than someone that already bought in.

## Future extensions

This dapp will be extended to add a Pay-To-Earn section. 

Here, students will be able to do a precourse to get them up to the level required to apply for our main bootcamp, as well as earn the DAO's ERC20 token in the process.
